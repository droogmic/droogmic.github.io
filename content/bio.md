I graduated in Information and Computer Engineering studying at Cambridge University. I am an avid programmer interested in Control Systems, Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

I am now looking for a exciting job in Software, Control and/or Systems Engineering. I am open to moving to different countries, I speak fluent French and basic German, and am looking for interesting challenges.

In my time at University I was a committed member of the Pembroke College Boat Club, having been on the committee for 2 years as Internet Secretary. As Regatta Secretary I was the organiser of the 2017 Pembroke Regatta, a rowing regatta on the river Cam with 40 volunteers, over 90 crews (800+ competitors), and 200 races.
I was also on the leadership team of Cambridge University Eco Racing (CUER), the top UK solar racing team. I spent 4 years with the team, in the Events, Operations and Logistics team, handling events, external contacts, health and safety, recruitment and finally coordinated the team's effort in bringing 20 people and a solar car to Australia to compete in the World Solar Challenge.
